Credit goes to Michael, Passion Wagon, Aurvi, and The Tempest for documentation on DW2. Credit also goes to AGamer for the development of the DW2 Modding Editors and Mod Manager.
I ask that if you use the scripts, make mods, and share mods that you give credit. I also ask that you let the modding editors and mod managers modify
the files, if you modify the files created with the modding editor and mod manager outside of the editor or mod manager it may cause errors and problems. So please, let the script
modify and create the files that the script makes.

Guide on modding:

1. Place the DW2_Editors.pyw file(DW2_Editors.exe file if using the executable) in the same directory as your DW2 bin file.

2. Rename the bin file to DW2.bin(it is because the script expects that for the filename).

3. extract the icon and background files from the DW2_Image_Files.zip file in the same directory as the DW2_Editors.pyw file((DW2_Editors.exe if using the executable file).

4. Before you edit a different character/stage slot or create a mod, click submit values to save your edits.

Guide on enabling mods(for unit editor and stage editor):

1. To enable a mod you need to click the mod manager button, enable mod button, and select the mod file that has the extension supported by the mod managers.

Guide on disabling unit mods:

1. To disable a mod you need to click the mod manager button, disable mod button, and select the file that has the extension supported by the mod manager.
The file used for disabling unit mods is in the Backups_For_Mod_Disabling folder.

Guide on disabling stage mods:
1. To disable a Stage mod you need to click the mod manager button, disable mod button, and select the file that has the extension supported by the mod managers.
Stage mods will have one of these extensions when created:
.DW2YTR, .DW2HLG, .DW2GD, .DW2CBan, .DW2CBi, .DW2HF, .DW2YL, and .DW2WZP
The files for disabling them are:
YTR_Stage.data, HLG_Stage.data, GD_Stage.data, CBan_Stage.data, CBi-Stage.data, HF_Stage.data, YL_Stage.data, WZP_Stage.data.
The files used to disable Stage mods are stored in the Backups_For_Mod_Disabling folder, select the file in that folder that matches the map that was modded.
Example:
Gongsun_Zan.HLG is a Hu Lao Gate Stage mod, to disable it you would select the HLG_Stage.data file.

Extra Information:
The pyw file is the source file, to use it you need Python installed. It can be used on its own or you can use the executable file instead. The executable file is a Python script
converted to an executable but the executable file may give off false virus/trojan warnings since it does not have code signing and is a Python file that doesn't require python installed.
The DW2_Editors.exe file is a standalone file, it does not require Python installed.

The Editors and Mod Managers work for the US version of Dynasty Warriors 2.
Mods created with the Editors can be shared and used by others(that means you can release the mod files), it requires them to have the Python script or executable file to enable and disable the mods.
